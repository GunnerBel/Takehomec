# Takehomec is a repository created to store a responsive html&css&Javascript files and a directory for two different challenges:
For both challenges I had to use multiple functions so that the program can function well

ArrayMap challenge 

Stringtransform challenge 

If you want to run them challenges you can use any IDE(Visual studio, webstorm, etc), and if you want to view and interact with the 
responsive page, it is so easy just use any editor and any browser to run it.
